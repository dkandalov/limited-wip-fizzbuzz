Watchdog and auto-revert (1 minute timeout):
- demo: TDD, watchdog and auto-revert
- 1
- 2, 3 (Fizz)
- 4, 5 (Buzz), 6 (committed at last moment / commented out to commit)
- 6-15 auto-revert
- 6 (Fizz rem)
- 7, 8, 9 (Fizz)
- 10 (Buzz), 15 (FizzBuzz with mangled commit message to be quick)
- 7, 14 (Woof)
- Woof combinations (commit without dialog)
- refactoring "if/else as expression"
- refactoring "lift return"
- refactoring "convert to when" (watchdog notification, commit anyway)
- add "fizz()/buzz()/woof()"
- refactoring "fizz()"
- refactoring "buzz()"
- refactoring "woof()"

TCR:
- demo: removed code -> can't commit; run tests -> committed; on failing test -> revert
- 1
- 2
- 3 (Fizz, shouldNotEqual)
- 4, 5 (Buzz, break assertions to test them)
- 6-15, FizzBuzz (rem Fizz and Buzz; limited by confidence in the change)
- 7 Woof (code first, test last)
- Woof combinations (code first, test last after commit)
- refactoring the order of "ifs" matter
- refactoring "if/else as expression", "lift return", "convert to when" (TCR perfect for refactoring)
- auto-revert of moving the order of conditions in "when"
- refactoring extract fizz(), buzz(), woof()
- failed refactoring fizz(n)
- micro-steps to refactor
- add FizzBuzzWoof test (because TCR is not compatible with TDD)
- code coverage
